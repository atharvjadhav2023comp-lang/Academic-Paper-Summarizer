# Academic-Paper-Summarizer
An AI-powered research paper summarization tool that leverages text compression and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to efficiently process lengthy academic documents while preserving technical accuracy and reducing computational overhead.



🧠 AI-Based Research Paper Summarization Tool
📌 Overview

This project is an AI-powered research paper summarization tool designed to efficiently process lengthy academic documents. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text compression techniques to generate concise summaries while preserving technical accuracy, key concepts, and domain-specific terminology.
The system significantly reduces processing time and computational overhead, making it suitable for large-scale academic analysis.
